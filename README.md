# Halal Compliance Demo (Basic vs Core)

A Streamlit demo you can host to explain your product to non-technical buyers (GCC-friendly).

## What it shows
### Basic
- Certificate vault
- Expiry alerts
- Supplier compliance view
- Audit pack download (demo ZIP)

### Core
- Everything in Basic
- Supplier intake that feels "OCR-like":
  - upload photo/PDF -> system pre-fills fields -> supplier confirms -> your team approves
- Approvals/change log
- Reminder centre (demo)

### Value
- ROI calculator (time + incident costs -> savings + payback)

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
